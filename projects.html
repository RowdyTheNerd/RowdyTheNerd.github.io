                    <h2>Backstory:</h2>
                        <p>During the autumn of 2024, I was attending computer science club, 
                            and one of our first assignments was to design a website for the club.
                            I had been wanting to start putting together a website for a week months at that point,
                            so it was the perfect opporitunity for me to get started learning how to do that sort of thing!
                            One of the leaders of the club walked me through setting up a website through github,
                            and once I had the first steps done I was already hooked.
                            As of writing this, ive spent most of my freetime in the 4 days since working on the site.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Current status:</h2>
                        <p>This website still has a long ways to go. 
                            there are plenty more features i want to add, a couple bugs to take care of, and so much more content.
                            however, given the fact that all this progress has been made in a couple days, 
                            I would say things are going well so far.</p>
                        <p>if you want to check the website out for yourself, then I have wonderful news.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>While working on my game during the summer of 2024 (see: Ante Suno), I realized 2 things:
                        <ol>
                            <li>I need a pixel font, and i dont't know where to find one.</li>
                            <li>I've wanted to make a font for a while now, and this would be a great excuse to start.</li>
                        </ol>
                        So, obviously, i hyperfixated for about a month on the project.
                        My font pack now includes 6 fonts, including 2 bold fonts, a sans-serif font, a serif font, a monotype font, and one silly one.
                        I will likely expand the collection in the future, but im happy with the current release. 
                        You can find all the fonts on my Itch.io page. THey are free to use for everyone! 
                        If you find a use for em, i hope you have fun with em, and pls send me whatever you make :3 
                        </p>

                <h1>Ante Suno</h1>
                <p>This is a project i started in summer of 2024. 
                    The beta was nearly finished, but it still needs a few tweaks before I feel like its ready for release.
                    Ante Suno is a retro puzzle game about navigating a house in the dark. 
                    It was based on an experience i had while visiting my dad's side of the family, 
                    and struggling to remember which switches did what.
                    The objective of each level is to get back to bed with as few lights left on as possible. 
                    There is still a long ways to go before the game is actually fun and playable. 
                    Unfortunately, development was interrupted when i had to go back to University at the end of the summer. 
                    It has since been on hiatus due to a lack of motivation and free time. 
                    however, id still like to come back to it some day.

                <h1>the Tumblr Object Tournament</h1>
                <p>Back when polls were first added to tumblr, there was a huge surge of tournament-style blogs.
                    Each blog would have a theme and a long list of contestants, usually 32-64. 
                    I thought this would be fun, so My contribution to the bandwagon was the Tumblr Object Tournament.</p>
                <p>Each matchup would have 2 random household objects being pitted against eachother. 
                    the objects were typically those that you might find around the house or on a desk, but there were some exceptions.
                    for example, one suggestion that i was hesitant to implement (but added anyways) was uranium pellets.
                    I initially said no, but they technically did not violate any rules, since you could safely hold them in your hand.</p>
                <p>The project has long since been abandoned, and I likely will not continue it anytime soon. 
                    Regardless, it was a fun way to occupy my time over the summer.
